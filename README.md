# Lab Assignment 3 – Responsive Portfolio Website

This project is an extended and improved version of my Lab Assignment 2 portfolio website.  
In this lab, I updated the structure, layout, and styling using modern CSS features like Flexbox, Grid, media queries, transitions, and animations.

##  Features Added in Lab 3
- **Flexbox**: Used for the header layout and hero section alignment.
- **CSS Grid**: Applied in the Skills and Projects sections for a clean card layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Website adjusts smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop using media queries.
- **Animations & Hover Effects**:
  - Smooth hover effects on buttons, links, and project cards.
  - Simple fade-in and color-change animations for a more modern feel.
- **Relative Units**: Used rem, %, and vh/vw for scalable spacing and typography.
- **Improved Visual Design**:
  - Updated color theme.
  - Added shadows, rounded corners, and cleaner spacing.
  - Included my own profile picture.

##  Tested Breakpoints
- **320px – 480px** (Mobile)
- **481px – 768px** (Tablet)
- **769px and above** (Desktop)

The layout reflows properly at each breakpoint.
